# The Challenge `r emo::ji("computer")`

* Choose one of the following data sets `r emo::ji("numbers")`
    * ONS Conceptions data (2017)
    * English indices of deprivation (2019)

--

* Do some analysis `r  emo::ji("magnifying")`
    * Plots
    * Summary statistics
    * Tables
    * Text
    * Statistical tests
    * Linear regression
    * Maps

--

* Communicate your findings `r emo::ji("graph")`
    * R Markdown document
    * R Markdown presentation
    * Flexdashboard
    * Shiny app

---

# Data set one: Conceptions in England and Wales `r emo::ji("baby")`

* [ONS website](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/conceptionandfertilityrates/datasets/conceptionstatisticsenglandandwalesreferencetables)

* This requires some wrangling to get into long form

* I've pre-processed table 1a, and 6 for you

* If you want to use the other tables - you'll have to process them yourselves!

* Code is in the repo

---

# Data set two: English indices of deprivation 2019 `r emo::ji("house")`

* [National Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019)

* Created by the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government

* LSOA level data, IMD rank, IMD decile, and rank and decile for each domain

* Additional info available online
    * Population demographics
    * LA aggregated data
    * CCG aggregated data

---

# Geographic data: Open Geography Portal `r emo::ji("world")`

* [Local Authority boundaries](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/local-authority-districts-december-2019-boundaries-uk-bfc)

* [Lower Layer Super Output Areas](https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/lower-layer-super-output-areas-december-2011-boundaries-ew-bsc?geometry=-13.162%2C52.284%2C7.767%2C54.575)

* Use `st_read("filename.shp)` from **sf** to read in data

* Use **dplyr** joins to join the shapefiles with the relevant statistics

* You might have to transform the CRS to get **leaflet** to work - ask!

# Tips `r emo::ji("bulb")`

* Pair programme - two/three to a laptop

* Start wide - then focus in

* Think about the story you are trying to tell

* Divide the work, one pair analyse, the other pair plan the communication

---

# Useful resources  `r emo::ji("books")`

* RStudio cheatsheets 

* RMarkdown templates

* [Templates / examples online](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)

* Each other!
