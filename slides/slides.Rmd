# The Challenge

* Choose one of the following data sets
    * ONS Conceptions data (2017)
    * English indices of deprivation (2019)

--

* Do some analysis
    * Plots
    * Summary statistics
    * Tables
    * Text
    * Statistical tests
    * Linear regression
    * Maps

--

* Communicate your findings
    * R Markdown document
    * R Markdown presentation
    * Flexdashboard
    * Shiny app

---

# Data set one: Conceptions in England and Wales

* [ONS website](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/conceptionandfertilityrates/datasets/conceptionstatisticsenglandandwalesreferencetables)

* This requires some wrangling to get into long form

* I've pre-processed table 1a, and 6 for you

* If you want to use the other tables- you'll have to process them yourselves!

* Code is in the repo

---

# Data set two: English indices of deprivation 2019

* [National Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/english-indices-of-deprivation-2019)

* Created by the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government

* LSOA level data, IMD rank, IMD decile, and rank and decile for each domain

* Additional info available online
    * Population demographics
    * LA aggregated data
    * CCG aggregated data

# Tips `r emo::ji("bulb")`

* Pair programme - two/three to a laptop

* Start wide - then focus in

* Think about the story you are trying to tell

* Divide the work, one pair analyse, the other pair plan the communication
